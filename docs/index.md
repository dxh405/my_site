## About me!

My name is Daniel Hough. I am studying DIGIT at Penn State Behrend. DIGIT stands for Digital Media, Arts, and Technology. This major really helps me capture my passion in working with photo, film, and sound.

In my time here I have gotten comfortable with many different programs. A lot of these are adobe programs. Photoshop, Illustrator, and Camera RawÂ  are my most comfortable. I also am pretty comfortable Premier Pro and am working on becoming more proficient everyday in all of these.

I have also worked with oXygen.XML with some work in text encoding. Along with several different Microsoft programs such as Word, Access, Excel, and PowerPoint.

My greatest interest and passion is esports. I hope one day to be able to utilize my skills somewhere in the esports field. Esports is electronic sports, or competitive gaming which I have been around nearly all of my life.
