[Short animation I made very early on in Adobe Premiere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARmrvIaVkWU&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=DannyHough).
As you can see I was very new to Premiere here, but it still took a while to create.

I work primarily in the adobe programs. I have the most experience with Photoshop and am learning new things everyday with it.

[I also have tried my hand at photography and created another website with my Photography portfolio](https://dxh405.wixsite.com/portfolio)
