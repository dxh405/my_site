[This is a link to the TimeMapper I made on the history of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive major tournaments](https://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/anon/ahsnuq-csgo-major-tournaments-timemapper#0)

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a mulitiplayer team based first person shooter. The Counter-Strike games have been around since the late 90s and have been pretty popular since. The esports scene for CS:GO is growing everyday and I am excited to watch and be a prat of it.
