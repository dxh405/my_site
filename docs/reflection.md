For this project we created 2 website with the same content but through two different means. Reflecting on the different aspects of both websites and things that we encountered while creating both.

I found that the creation of both websites had their upsides and their downsides. With WordPress, I found that adding content such as photos and and media content to that website was much easier initially, but became frustrating over time as the websites control and dashboard feels clunky. While using GitHub website this problem was reversed. At first it was frustrating to get media to properly load, but over time when I got used to the process of uploading, it became significantly easier to use. I still have a lot of learning to do with GitHub, especially in the layout area. That just comes with time and practice.

Overall both processes had their benefits and their flaws. I do not really have a preference of either of them as of now, but I do predict that the GitHub site will be something I will actually update and learn more and more as it feels a lot more customizable.
